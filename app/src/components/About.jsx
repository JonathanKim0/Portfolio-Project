        <p id='description'>Hello, <br/><br/>
        I'm Jonathan Kim, a passionate Software Engineer based in Montreal, Canada. I've always had a passion for STEM subjects such as math and technology. Fueled <br/>
        by my desire to learn, I love to tackle difficult and complex problems that challenge me to think outside of the box. I always seek to create simple and elegant solutions.<br/>
        I'm a firm believer that clean and readable code comes a very long way. I have developped an interest in AI and machine learning, and I'm constantly exploring how <br/>
        these technologies can be used to create smarter and modern applications. When I'm not behind the screen, you'll find me cooking up some of my favourite dishes, rock <br/>
        climbing, or even biking around the island. I'm always eager to learn and grow, both in the tech world and beyond. <br/><br/>
        Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out for potential collaborations.
