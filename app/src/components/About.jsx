          Hello!
          <br />
          <br />
          I'm Jonathan Kim, a passionate Software Engineer based in Montreal,
          Canada. During the last three years, I have been studing at Ã‰cole
          Polytechnique of Montreal to earn my Bachelor of Science in Software
          Engineering.
          <br />
          <br />
          Over the period of my studies I have developed a strong interest in
          Artificial Intelligence and Cybersecurity. Many of my projects were
          created to learn and deepen my understanding of these topics. I have
          gained proficiency in languages such as Java, C++, C#, Python, and
          have experience with frameworks such as React, NodeJS and Express. I
          love to tackle challenging and complex problems that make me to think
          outside of the box. I always seek to create simple and elegant
          solutions. I'm constantly exploring how our technologies can be used
          to create greater experiences. I'm always eager to learn and grow,
          both in the tech world and beyond.
          <br />

          Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects
          and reach out for collaborations.
