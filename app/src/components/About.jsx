          I'm Jonathan Kim, a passionate Software Engineer based in Montreal, Canada. I've always had a passion for STEM subjects such as math and technology. Fueled
          by my desire to learn, I love to tackle difficult and complex problems that challenge me to think outside of the box.I always seek to create simple 
          and elegant solutions. I'm a firm believer that clean and readable code comes a very long way. I have developped an interest in AI and machine learning, 
          and I'm constantly exploring how these technologies can be used to create smarter and modern applications. When I'm not behind the screen, you'll find me 
          cooking up some of my favourite dishes, rock climbing, or even biking around the island. I'm always eager to learn and grow, both in the tech world and beyond.
